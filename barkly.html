                                <h1 id="op-overview">Overview</h1>
                                <p>
                                    Barkly is a service that allows customers to arrange on-demand or pre-scheduled walks for their dogs. In order to provide convenient and consistent care, Barkly hires only the best walkers and provides them with extensive training and background checks to ensure quality. The product pairs each dog with one walker who provides individualized service and post-walk reports to the pet owner.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Barkly manages its business from both the customer side and the walker side through an app for iOS and Android. I worked closely with Barkly’s CTO to redesign user flows for both customer and walker apps, and to wireframe concepts for a new UI.
                                </p>
                            </article>

                            <article>
                                <h1 id="op-challenge">Challenge</h1>
                                <p>
                                    Barkly is a trustworthy service with a dedicated user base and high rate of repeat usage. Now that its services are expanding to new cities, however, the company is redesigning the app to more widely appeal to first-time users and more clearly communicate the trustworthiness of its services. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Additionally, making the walker app easier to use means that Barkly’s walkers can care for dogs and submit reports to customers with fewer hurdles. A facelift for the app also means that new walker onboarding will be easier in their expanding markets.
                                </p>
                            </article>

                            <article>
                                <h1 id="op-approach">Approach</h1>
                                <p>
                                    Barkly’s app needs to be used both by its customers—people booking walks for their dogs—as well as its walkers. The product’s extensive feature list allows for easy booking and walking, but the sheer amount of information needed on both sides can make the app intimidating for both sets of users. I therefore spent a lot of time getting to know Barkly’s customers, walkers, and goals for the service, including the feature priorities for all involved parties.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I, along with Barkly’s CTO, interviewed both customers and walkers for feedback, then analyzed the information to determine the most important features for each user set. I then used this information to update the owner-side information architecture and user flows. I also created wireframes for the product’s most important screens.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Customer Research</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Barkly had collected feedback from many of its regular users and we spoke to some dog owners who had not yet used the app. Analysis of this feedback suggested the following needs:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Easier walk-booking process.</strong> Booking a walk requires a lot of information from the customer, especially for a first-time use. It wasn’t consistently obvious what each input field needed (which made it difficult for walkers to receive certain necessary information), and when a new user left the page to add new information, they weren’t always directed back to the same page. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>More intuitive app flow.</strong> The app originally opened up to a map, and while this is a familiar interface for users (Uber, etc.) it wasn’t the most important information that dog owners needed upon opening the app, especially after their first use when the dog’s pickup address is already set. Furthermore, certain functionality was difficult to locate or understand.  
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Greater acknowledgement of talent.</strong> Return users had assigned walkers that they were comfortable and familiar with, but new users did not immediately understand that they would be assigned a walker according to their dog’s needs, that this walker would take care of all of their walks (if available), and that they would have the chance to meet this walker before booking a walk. The overall feeling of the app also needed an update to communicate that the service was not only transactional, but instead caring and dedicated to a pet’s needs. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    I also researched both competitors in the space (Rover, Wag) and companies with similar UI elements (Uber, Seamless, Amazon). For the competitors, I focused on how they created trust with their customers as well as what information they collected and how. For other products with similar elements, I looked at how the product stored routine information, like addresses and payment options, and where in the app or transaction the user confirmed or added that information. 
                                </p>

                                <h2>Walker Research</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Barkly also collected feedback from its most trusted walkers, including one call with a walker in which I participated. Most of the walkers’ concerns had to do with organizing the sheer amount of information needed to understand a pet’s needs and keep the walks running smoothly, though there were also comments about the app’s scheduling features and customer-walker interactions. Overall, we received the following feedback:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Guide customers through information collection.</strong> The walkers need a ton of information to do their jobs, including where the dog is kept in the home, information about the dog (where it likes to be walked, what it’s afraid of, etc.), and specifics about the walk that day. Currently, much of this information is entered via a customer note, but long notes can be “daunting” and can lead to walkers missing important details. Guiding the customer through an organized collection of information would make the walkers’ job much easier.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Easier interface for walk schedules.</strong> Because Barkly has customers schedule walks within 3-hour blocks, the walkers are responsible for creating their own routes to cover the walks scheduled within those blocks. Walkers liked the chronological listing of upcoming walks, but expressed a need for a map to help better plan their routes. Reporting their availability for scheduled walks could also be improved.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>More walk-friendly features.</strong> The walkers need to pay attention to the dog while on a walk, but are distracted by having to look at their phone screens for information like the time left in the walk or specific notes about the walk itself. The process to leave a walk summary for the dog owner is also buggy and time-consuming, adding unnecessary bulk to the walk. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    I was unable to see the walker-side versions of competitor apps, but I did look at scheduling products like Zoom, Calend.ly, and Google Calendar to see how they handled similar situations.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Information Architecture & User Flows</h2>
                                <p>
                                    When designing the new flows, I used both the feedback we received as well as Barkly’s needs for the app to direct me. You’ll notice that there are two updated charts below; since it wasn’t clear what would work best, I designed two, one to collect customer and pet information up-front and one with a lighter registration experience, so Barkly could test which would attract more first-time users.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Both flows have the same general structure. Both first show options for a new walk, scheduled walks, or past walks, which were the most important elements for both owners and the Barkly team. Both also get rid of the menu sidebar, which was functioning a bit like a junk drawer and difficult to navigate.
                                </p>

                                    I then worked with a developer on the project to rank each screen’s most important information and brainstorm different UIs in line with the existing code base. Below are some samples from the brainstorm.

                                    The team will be moving forward with screens made up of elements from a few of the wireframes below. Barkly will be utilizing Material Design for its new app, a consideration I kept in mind while designing. The below is optimized for Android, but the team will also create a version with iOS design standards.

                                    Working on Barkly’s app has really taught me the importance of storytelling in app production. Barkly had a functional product with loyal customers, so their product was obviously working for them. When expanding to new markets, however, the functionality of the app didn’t matter as much as the overall experience. Dog owners wanted the app to communicate the company’s trustworthiness and transparency, and dog walkers wanted the app to help them focus on the dogs they were caring for. By updating the app’s organization and interface, the app speaks more clearly to what Barkly actually is (and can do for the people who use it!).
