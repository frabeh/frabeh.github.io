                                    Barkly is an iOS & Android app that allows customers to arrange on-demand or pre-scheduled walks for their dogs. In order to provide convenient and consistent care, Barkly hires only the best walkers and provides them with extensive training and background checks to ensure quality. The product pairs each dog with one walker who provides individualized service and post-walk reports to the pet owner.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I worked closely with Barkly’s CTO to conduct user research, redesign information architecture for both customer and walker apps, and wireframe concepts for a new UI.

                                    Barkly is a trustworthy service with a dedicated user base and high rate of repeat usage. Now that its services are expanding to new cities, however, the company is redesigning the app to more widely appeal to first-time users and more clearly communicate the trustworthiness of its services. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Additionally, making the walker app easier to use means that Barkly’s walkers can care for dogs and submit reports to customers with fewer hurdles. A facelift for the app also means that new walker onboarding will be easier in their expanding markets.
                                </p>

                                    Barkly's extensive feature list allows for easy booking and walking, but the amount of information needed can make the app intimidating for both pet owners and walkers. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I spent a lot of time getting to know Barkly’s customers, walkers, and goals for the service, including the feature priorities for all involved parties.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I, along with Barkly’s CTO, interviewed both customers and walkers. Using this, I updated the owner-side information architecture, user flows, and wireframes.

                                <h2>Customer Research</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Analysis Barkly's user feedback suggested the following needs:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Easier walk-booking.</strong> This process requires a lot of information, especially for first-time use. The requirements for each input field weren't obvious, which also made it difficult for walkers to receive information. Also, when a user left the page to add new information, they weren’t always directed back to the same page. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>More intuitive app flow.</strong> The original homescreen was a map; while familiar, it did not show the most important information for a pet owner. Certain functionality was also difficult to locate or understand.  
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Greater acknowledgement of walker talent.</strong> Users are assigned walkers to care for their pets and have the option to meet a walker before their first walk, but new users often did not know this. The app also needed to better communicate that the service is caring and dedicated to a pet’s needs. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Additionally, I researched competitors in the space (Rover, Wag) and companies with similar UI elements (Uber, Seamless, Amazon) to see how they created trust with their customers, what information they collected and how, and where information is stored within the app. 
                                </p>

                                <h2>Walker Research</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Barkly also collected feedback from its most trusted walkers, including one call with a walker in which I participated. Overall, we received the following feedback:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Guide customers through information collection.</strong> Most of the information that walkers need (where the dog is in the home, walk specifics, dogs' preferences, etc.) is entered into a customer note, and inconsistent entry makes it easy for walkers to miss important details. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Easier interface for walk schedules.</strong> Walkers are responsible for creating their own routes for walks scheduled within a three-hour block. Though the app's chronological walk list is helpful, walkers also needed a map to help better plan their routes. Reporting their availability for walks could also be improved.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>More walk-friendly features.</strong> The walkers need to look at the app for information about the walk, remaining walk time, etc., which prevents them from paying full attention to the dogs. The process to leave a walk summary for the dog owner is also buggy and time-consuming, adding unnecessary bulk to the walk. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    I was unable to see the walker-side versions of competitor apps, but I did look at scheduling products like Zoom, Calend.ly, and Google Calendar to see how they handled similar situations.

                                <p>
                                    When designing the new flows, I used both the feedback we received as well as Barkly’s needs for the app to direct me. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The new flow is lighter for both the user and developer. I nested similar information whenever possible, making the flow more intuitive. I also removed the menu sidebar, which was functioning a bit like a junk drawer and difficult to navigate.
                                </p>

                                    I then worked with a developer on the project to rank each screen’s most important information and brainstorm different UIs in line with the existing code base. Below are some samples from the brainstorm.

                                    The team will be moving forward with screens made up of elements from a few of the wireframes below. Barkly will be utilizing Material Design for its new app, a consideration I kept in mind while designing. The below is optimized for Android, but the team will also create a version with iOS design standards.

                                    Working on Barkly’s app has really taught me the importance of storytelling in app production. Barkly had a functional product with loyal customers, so their product was obviously working for them. When expanding to new markets, however, the functionality of the app didn’t matter as much as the overall experience. Dog owners wanted the app to communicate the company’s trustworthiness and transparency, and dog walkers wanted the app to help them focus on the dogs they were caring for. By updating the app’s organization and interface, the app speaks more clearly to what Barkly actually is (and can do for the people who use it!).
